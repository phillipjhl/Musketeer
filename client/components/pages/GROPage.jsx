                The timely tasks required to have an adundant and healthy garden
                can seem endless. Many gardeners struggle to know what all they
                need to do in order to keep their plants from dying. Not to
                mention, traditional gardening methods, such as garden center
                plant tags, left a lot of questions unanswered so that caring
                for plants felt like a guessing game.

            <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
            <p>
              After completing a high fidelity prototype of the app, it was time
              to test it on a group of gardeners. I performed two rounds of
              usability testing, with five participants each round. The first
              round of testing was during the low-fidelity mockup stage while
              the second was using a high-fidelity prototype. Each round of
              testing was followed by a usability test report, solution
              ideation, and a new iteration of the app.

              Below is a break down of the plant profile to show a brief
              explanation of how this product would be successful in helping
              gardeners have more success understanding plant needs in order to
              develop a maintenance plan. Once they add a plant to their “My
              Plants” section, they are recommended tasks and give reminders
              when they need to be completed.

            <p>
              By completing this project, I enjoyed getting to work through the
              entire end-to-end design process. The magnitude of this project
              was intimidating at first, but during the process I grew as a
              designer by tackling ambiguities head-on and seeking advice from
              peers and mentors. After completing this project, I feel more
              confident in my abilities to advocate for users and develop simple
              and intuitive designs and went on to have the opportunity to
              present this project along with its research and design solutions.
